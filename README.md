# Data-Mining-Project
The aim of this project is to find the best predictive model to predict the income category of urban households using the data of the household income and expenditure plan in 2021, which was prepared by the Iranian Statistics Center.
## Data Information
To collect the data related to this project, we used the questionnaire of urban households' expenditure and income plan, which includes the following items:
* Social characteristics of family members
* The details of the place of residence and facilities and the main necessities of life
* Household food and non-food expenses
* Household incomes
<br>NOTE: Each of the above includes several variables in the data, which are provided with more information in the report file.
## Model
After cleaning and collecting the data, we tried to get general information from the data and the relationship between the variables using statistical charts and visualization.
<br> Then we used the following models for statistical modeling:
* logistic regression
* decision tree
* knn
* neural network
## Conclusion
After modeling and applying it on the training and test data, we compared the results of the models in terms of specificity, sensitivity and accuracy parameters and chose the best model for predicting and classifying households into different income deciles.
